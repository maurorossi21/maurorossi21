# üí´ About Me:
- Hello! I‚Äôm Mauro, a web development enthusiast currently studying to become a full-stack<br> developer. I'm committed to building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I work<br> towards mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.<br><br>- I am currently practicing HTML and CSS to build a solid understanding of both languages and to feel <br>more comfortable when transitioning to JavaScript. My goal is to learn JavaScript, React, TypeScript,<br> Node.js, Python, and finally Django within one year.<br><br>- Q1:  Strengthen HTML and CSS skills, then dive deeply into JavaScript until I'm comfortable with it.<br>- Q2:  Learn React and TypeScript to start building dynamic web applications.<br>- Q3:  Begin working with Node.js and Python to expand into backend development.<br>- Q4:  Learn Django and integrate front-end and back-end skills to create full-stack projects.<br><br>- Feel free to check out my progress and projects here on GitHub :)<br>
